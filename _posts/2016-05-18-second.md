### Abstracts

**<a name="VS"></a>Hash Proof Systems, Old and New**<br>
*Victor Shoup, NYU*

This talk will be an exposition on hash proof systems and
their applications. I will review the basic definitions,
constructions, and applications of hash proof systems, focusing on the
original application to chosen ciphertext secure public key
encryption, as well as more recent applications to password
authenticated key exchange.
