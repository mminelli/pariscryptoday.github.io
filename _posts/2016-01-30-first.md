### Abstracts

**<a name="AJ"></a>Technical History of Discrete Logarithms in Small Characteristic Finite Fields**
*Antoine Joux*

Due to its use in cryptographic protocols such as the Diffie--Hellman
key exchange, the discrete logarithm problem attracted a considerable
amount of attention in the past 40 years. In this talk, we summarize
the key technical ideas and their evolution for the case of discrete
logarithms in small characteristic finite fields. This road leads from
the original belief that this problem was hard enough for
cryptographic purpose to the current state of the art where the
algorithms are so efficient and practical that the problem can no
longer be considered for cryptographic use.

**<a name="SB"></a>On the Use of Masking to Defeat Power-Analysis Attacks**
*Sonia Belaïd*

While most cryptographic algorithms are assumed to be secure against
black-box attacks, they are often vulnerable to side-channel attacks
which exploit the physical emanations of the underlying device (e.g.,
temperature, power consumption, time). In order to defeat such
attacks, several countermeasures have been exhibited within the last
two decades. So far, the most deployed one at the algorithmic level is
probably the use of masking. It consists in randomly splitting each
sensitive variable of the computation into t+1 shares, where the
masking order t represents the security level. While this
countermeasure is very efficient in practice, it can be complex to
design while t grows. During this talk, I will discuss the current
issues to build higher-order masking schemes and the solutions that
currently show up. In particular, I will present the construction of
theoretical proofs to show the security of such schemes in the widely
used t-probing leakage model.

**<a name="RG"></a>Tightly Secure CCA-Secure Encryption without Pairings**
*Romain Gay*

We present the first CCA-secure public-key encryption scheme based on
DDH where the security loss is independent of the number of challenge
ciphertexts and the number of decryption queries. Our construction
extends also to the standard k-Lin assumption in pairing-free groups,
whereas all prior constructions starting with Hofheinz and Jager
(Crypto '12) rely on the use of pairings. Moreover, our construction
improves upon the concrete efficiency of existing schemes, reducing
the ciphertext overhead by about half (to only 3 group elements under
DDH), in addition to eliminating the use of pairings. We also show how
to use our techniques in the NIZK setting. Specifically, we construct
the first tightly simulation-sound designated-verifier NIZK for linear
languages without pairings. Using pairings, we can turn our
construction into a highly optimized publicly verifiable NIZK with
tight simulation-soundness.

**<a name="PM"></a>Towards Stream Ciphers for Efficient FHE with Low-Noise Ciphertexts**
*Pierrick Méaux*

Symmetric ciphers purposed for Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) have
recently been proposed for two main reasons. First, minimizing the
implementation (time and memory) overheads that are inherent to
current FHE schemes. Second, improving the homomorphic capacity,
i.e. the amount of operations that one can perform on homomorphic
ciphertexts before bootstrapping, which amounts to limit their level
of noise.  Existing solutions for this purpose suggest a gap between
block ciphers and stream ciphers. The first ones typically allow a
constant but small homomorphic capacity, due to the iteration of
rounds eventually leading to complex Boolean functions (hence large
noise). The second ones typically allow a larger homomorphic capacity
for the first ciphertext blocks, that decreases with the number of
ciphertext blocks (due to the increasing Boolean complexity of the
stream ciphers' output).  In this work, we aim to combine the best of
these two worlds, and propose a new stream cipher construction that
allows constant and small(er) noise. Its main idea is to apply a
Boolean (filter) function to a public bit permutation of a constant
key register, so that the Boolean complexity of its outputs is
constant.  We then propose an instantiation of the filter designed to
exploit recent (3rd-generation) FHE schemes, where the error growth is
quasi-additive when adequately multiplying ciphertexts with the same
amount of noise.  We finally analyze the cryptanalytic security and
noise of a couple of instances of this stream cipher, and conclude by
highlighting its excellent properties regarding the other goal of
minimizing the time and memory complexity of calculus delegation (for
2nd-generation FHE schemes).

**<a name="AP"></a>Randomness Complexity of Private Circuits for Multiplication**
*Alain Passelègue*

Many cryptographic algorithms appear to be vulnerable to side channel
analysis and several leakage models have been introduced to better
understand these analyses. In 2003, Ishai, Sahai and Wagner introduced
the $d$-probing security model, in which an attacker can observe at
most $d$ intermediate values during a processing. They also proposed
an algorithm that securely performs the multiplication of 2 bits in
this model, using only $d(d+1)/2$ random bits to protect the
computation.  The $d$-probing model and the latter multiplication
algorithm are nowadays widely used by the community to either prove
the security of constructions or to define secure implementations.

In this paper, we study the randomness complexity of multiplication
algorithms secure in the $d$-probing model. On this subject, we
propose several contributions: we provide new theoretical
characterizations and constructions, new practical constructions and a
new efficient algorithmic tool to analyze the security of such
schemes.

We first start by a theoretical treatment of the subject: we propose
an algebraic model for multiplication algorithms and exhibit an
algebraic characterization of the security in the $d$-probing
model. Using this algebraic characterization, we prove a linear (in
$d$) lower bound as well as a quasi-linear (non-constructive) upper
bound for this randomness cost.  This characterization also allows us
to better understand the security of a multiplication algorithm and we
construct a new generic algorithm to perform secure multiplication in
the $d$-probing model that only uses $d + d^2/4$ random bits.

From a practical point of view, we consider the important cases $d \le
4$ that are actually used in real-life implementations and we build
optimal algorithms for these small-order cases. More precisely, we
propose algorithms with a randomness complexity matching our
theoretical lower bound. Finally, still using our algebraic
characterization, we provide a new dedicated verification tool, based
on information set decoding, which aims at finding attacks on
algorithms for fixed order $d$ at a very low computational cost.
